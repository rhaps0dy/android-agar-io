# android-agar-io
Agar.io client for Android in Haskell, using SDL.

# How to run
- Build a cross-compiling GHC toolchain following the instructions in
  [my ghc-android fork](https://github.com/rhaps0dy/ghc-android)
- Clone this repository somewhere.
- Copy `local.properties.default` to `local.properties` and edit it to suit
  your environment. If you used the same directories as explained in the
  instructions for building the cross-compilers, you will only have to change
  your username.
- Open the project on Android Studio, and click play! Alternatively, use Gradle.
